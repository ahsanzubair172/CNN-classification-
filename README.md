# CNN Image Classification 📊🧠

A complete walkthrough of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. This project includes two notebooks: one focusing on building a basic CNN model and the other on applying data augmentation techniques to improve performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates:
- How to construct a CNN model from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.
- How to preprocess and augment image datasets.
- Training and evaluation of CNN models for classification tasks.
- Insights into model performance improvements through image augmentation.
